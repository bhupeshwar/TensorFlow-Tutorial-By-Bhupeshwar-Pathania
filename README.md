# TensorFlow Tutorial By Bhupeshwar Pathania

TensorFlow is a powerful open-source machine-learning framework developed by Google, that empowers developers to construct and train ML models. 
It is used to implement machine learning and deep learning applications, for the development and research of fascinating ideas in artificial intelligence. 
TensorFlow is designed with the Python programming language, which makes it an easily understandable framework.

# What is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is a software library that excels in numerical computations and large-scale data analysis. It underpins various Google products, including search and recommendations, demonstrating its real-world prowess. TensorFlow offers two primary interfaces for building ML models:

Keras: A high-level API ideal for beginners and rapid prototyping. Keras abstracts away complexities, enabling you to focus on model design and experimentation.
TensorFlow Core API: A low-level, more granular approach offering finer control over model architecture and computations. This is preferred for experienced developers or situations requiring extensive customization.

# TensorFlow - Installation

Step 1 − Verify the python version being installed.
Step 2 − A user can pick up any mechanism to install TensorFlow in the system. I recommend “pip” and “Anaconda”. 
Pip is a command used for executing and installing modules in Python.

Before you install TensorFlow, you need to install Anaconda framework in your system.

After successful installation, check in command prompt through “conda” command. The execution of command is displayed below −

Step 3 − Execute the following command to initialize the installation of TensorFlow −

<code> conda create --name tensorflow python = 3.11 </code>

Step 4 − After successful environmental setup, it is important to activate TensorFlow module.

<code> activate tensorflow </code>

Step 5 − Use pip to install “Tensorflow” in the system. The command used for installation is mentioned as below −

<code> pip install tensorflow </code>

And,

<code> pip install tensorflow-gpu </code>
